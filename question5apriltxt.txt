Create an Abstract class Processor with int member variable data and method
showData to display data value. 
a.Create abstract method process() to define processing of member data.a. 
Create a class Factorial using abstract class Processor to calculate and print 
factorial of a number by overriding the process method.
b. Create a class Circle using abstract class Processor to calculate and print area
of a circle by overriding the process method Ask user to enter choice (factorial 
or circle area). Also ask data to work upon; Use Processor class reference to 
achieve this mechanism

1) Create three classes Faculty (facultyid, salary) 
FullTimeFaculty (basic, allowance) inherits class Faculty 
PartTimeFaculty (hour, rate) inherits class Faculty 
Create a method for accepting input in FullTimeFaculty and 
PartTimeFaculty, but salary should not be accepted. Salary is 
calculated on the basis of (basic+allowance) for FullTimeFaculty and 
(hour*rate) for PartTimeFaculty. Also create method in above classes 
to display faculty data. 
 Create another class(say XYZ) for main method and store 2 fulltime 
and 2 parttime faculty information. Also print their details.
